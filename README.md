## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client is a software company that has developed an Android game and wants to expand the player base by making the game available for multiple platforms. They wanted me to design the web-based environment for the game so that it can be deployed to all of the major platforms (Windows, Mac, Linus, iOS, and Android).

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that my descriptions and wording was fairly easy to follow and understand. 

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document gives direction to the project. It helps the developer understand exactly what the task is and makes it easier for the team to make a selection on how the application should be developed based on various categories such as budget, security, and compatablility. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise my recommendations section to include a little more detail as to why my recommendations are what they are. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Ultimately, the end-user is the most important piece of any software. They will determine the success and life-span of the application. In this project, our end-user was the Gaming Room. We had a detailed description of what they actually wanted us to do and that allowed us to design the application that they needed.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In the past, my approach was not planned. I would generally just get started, lose direction, and not finish the project that I started. After this class, I understand the importance of planning ahead to have direction in my projects.
